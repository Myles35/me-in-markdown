I'm excited to learn coding and different script in your class and I want to understand the concepts of each code. Sometimes I'll draw something but haven't had anytime to draw anything through the summer. So I'm thinking of possibly learning how to draw faces and shading properly so far my summer was honestly great overall was able to hang out with friends went to beach with one of them it was great time
